# Code Refactor

Horiseon is a company that provides an apleathora of social solution services, ranging from Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management to Social Media Marketing. As a marketing agency, Horiseon requested that we clean up their codebase to meet accessibility standards and that their site is optimized for search engines.
With changes to their HTML and CSS style sheet, we have improved their title element to be more concise and descriptive. The heading attributes now fall in sequential order with semantic HTML elements when viewing their source code. The structure of the HTML elements now follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. We've also made sure all of their image elements include accessible alt attributes. All links are functioning correctly and CSS has been cleaned up to be more efficient. Their website is good to go!
